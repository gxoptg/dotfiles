# Ivan Akulov’s dotfiles

_dotfiles_ are configuration files that I use on PCs I work with.

## What’s included

* `.gitconfig` file with author’s name, email, aliases and useful settings
* PowerShell profile with custom prompt and posh-git support

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/iamakulov/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    .\init.ps1

_Note:_ the initialization script was not tested yet and may work improperly.
